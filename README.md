# Hey there 👋

I’m Govinda — a coder on a journey,  
weaving code like threads of thought,  
where every project is a small adventure  
and every bug a hidden lesson. 🌿🌱💻

---

## 🚀 What I’m up to
- Building **web apps** that are simple, functional, and elegant  
- Exploring **Flask, React, Ionic, and Django** for full-stack development  
- Curious about **AI and how it can shape ideas**  
- Breaking things… so I can fix them better 😄
